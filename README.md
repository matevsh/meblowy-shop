## 🚧The project is in production, so some functionality may not work🏭

## 📋Description
The project is an e-commerce platform built with Next.js and Nest.js, leveraging the power of TypeScript. It encompasses a range of features, starting from essential online shopping functionalities and culminating in a robust and fully operational sales platform.

## 📈Motivation
My main objective in building this platform was to test my skills with Next.js and Nest.js, while also gaining familiarity with new technologies that I had not previously worked with.
